## BUILDING BLOCKS OF POWER BI
* 2 Building Blocks of Power BI
  1. Semantic models
  2. Visualizations

## 1.CREATE A SEMANTIC MODEL
Semantic model consists of all connected data ,transformations,relationships and calculations. 
* we first connect to ``data`` ,``transform data`` ,and ``create relationships and calculations`` to create a semantic model
* Connect to as many data sources that you need,then clean and transform the data to your needs,
* Add relationships between tables and calculations to extends the semantic model

## CREATE VISUALIZATIONS IN A REPORT
* you add it to canvas for a report page,choose your visuaization to build pages in your report
* valuable features of power bi reports is the interactivity between visuals.where consumers can select different data points in the visual and see how that affects the other visualsj

## CREATE A DASHBOARD
You can also create dashboards after you,ve published a report.In a way dahsboards consists of a single page made up of tiles.Add tiles to a dashboard by pinning a visual in a report to the dashboard.Tiles aren't interactive like visuals ,so in a way when a user interacts with the tile ,they go to the underlying report for more information
