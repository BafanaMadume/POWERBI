* valuable features of power bi reports is the interactivity between visuals.where consumers can select different data points in the visual and see how that affects the other visualsj

## CREATE A DASHBOARD
You can also create dashboards after you,ve published a report.In a way dahsboards consists of a single page  made up of tiles.Add tiles to a dashboard by pinning a visual in a report to the dashboard.Tiles aren't interactive like visuals ,so in a way when a user interacts with the tile ,they go to the underlying report for more information
* Dashboards are an excellent way to provide high-level information to consumers
* Power BI Service ,We can distribute content

## Organize Items With WorkSpaces
- When publishing any report ,you must choose a workspace.My workspace is ideal only for testing ,whenever you want to share content with other individuals we create and use a shared workspace.
